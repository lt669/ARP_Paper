@article{Noisternig2003,
abstract = {A computationally efficient 3D real time rendering engine for binaural sound reproduction via headphones is presented. Binaural sound reproduction requires to filter the virtual sound source signals with head related transfer functions (HRTFs). To improve humans localization capabilities head tracking as well as room simulation have to be incorporated. This yields the problem of high-quality, time-varying interpolation between different HRTFs. To overcome this problem a virtual ambisonic approach is used that results in a bank of time-invariant HRTF filter.},

@article{Bertet2007,
abstract = {Natural sound field can be reproduced through loudspeakers using ambisonics and Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA) microphone recordings. The HOA sound field encoding approach is based on spherical harmonics decomposition. The more components used to encode the sound field, the finer the spatial resolution is. As a result of previous studies, two HOA (2nd and 4th order) microphone prototypes have been developed. To evaluate the perceived spatial resolution and encoding artefacts on the horizontal plane, a localisation test was performed comparing these prototypes, a SoundField microphone and a simulated ideal 4th order encoding system. The HOA reproduction system was composed of twelve loudspeakers equally distributed on a circle. Thirteen target positions were chosen around the listener. An adjustment method using an auditory pointer was used to avoid bias effects of usual reporting methods. The human localisation error occurring for each of the tested systems has been compared. A statistical analysis showed significance differences when using the 4th order system, the 2nd order system and the SoundField microphone.},
