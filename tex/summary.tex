\section{Summary}

	A live musical performance was recorded at Abbey Road Studios with a number of different multichannel microphone arrays, Ambisonic microphones and 360\textdegree{} cameras. An Ambisonic workflow was established which was used to process the audio mix ready for a VR environment coupled with 360\textdegree{} video and real time head tracking. The VR experience was assessed across two listening tests to gather data on the different microphones used in the recording process. The results indicate that mixing in a multichannel microphone array, the best tested being the OCT or Hamasaki Cube, or an Ambisonic microphone with a spot microphone mix improves the viewers perception of spatial audio attributes which leads to a more enjoyable experience.
